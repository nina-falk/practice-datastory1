          <h2>Introduction: Where Are School-Based Health Centers — and Who’s Missing Out?</h2>

              <p>  For a lot of children, schools aren't just places for learning. They are community spaces where children spend majority of their time and life where they go to access support for their physical, mental, and environmental health and well being. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) play a big role in this support system. They provide students with the access they need for medical, mental health, and sometimes dental services directly in their schools. For some students who face barries to healthcare like lack of insurance, transportation, community support, and flexible work schedules SBHC’s can be life changing for families. </p> 
                
             <p>  Unfortunately, In Connecticut, not every school district or town has a SBHC. This uneven access may reflect broader inequities across communities which raises important questions about equity. Are SBHC’s located in towns that need them most - the towns with higher poverty rates, and larger populations relying on health insurance? Are the only in towns or wealthier areas with fewer barriers to receiving care? </p>

          
             <p> Our question asks: how towns with School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) differ from those without -in terms of median household income and the percentage of residents receiving Medicaid health insurance (also known as “HUSKY” or a “medical benefit plan” from CT Dept of Social Services, DSS). These two indicators show much more about broader economic and healthcare access disparities across Connecticut. If towns lacking SBHCs generally have higher incomes and fewer residents on Medicaid, that could mean that the communities with the greatest need for school-based health services may have the least access to them. 	</p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>

        <p> This bar chart shows the comparison of Median Household Income in towns that have SBHC's and towns that do not. </p>

       <iframe title="Median Value of Median Household Income in Connecticut Towns" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-THCIx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/THCIx/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="656" height="485" data-external="1"></iframe>

       <p> This is important as it shows that towns that have a lower median household income tend to have more SBHC's. This is a good thing as there may be a higher need in the communities that are recieving acess to the SBHC's. </p>

       <p> Both of these interactive chloropleth maps show the Median Household Income of Towns with SBHC’s vs. Towns without SBHC’s. It also shows how many SBHC’s are in each town.  </p>

           <p> This is important as it shows how some towns that boarder each other (New Britain vs. Newington) can have a vast difference in the amount of SBHC’S. There is a 13:1 difference, respectively. Children’s health needs can be more difficult to meet due to the location of their school and home. </p> 

          <p>  HUSKY is Connecticut’s version of Medicaid. It also includes the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides coverage for children whose families make too much to qualify for regular Medicaid. </p>

         <p> The chart outlines the differences between A, B, C, and D. It compares them side by side so it’s easy to see how they vary in terms of who they cover, how they work, and what they provide. </p>

          <h2>Our Process</h2>

          <p>For our project, we began by defining our main research question: how Connecticut towns with school-based health centers differ from those without them in terms of median household income and the percentage of residents receiving Medicaid, including HUSKY A, B, C, D, and MSP. We reviewed background information from the <a href="https://www.cthealth.org/topic-guides/medicaid-in-ct/">Medicaid topic Guide</a> and <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-People-Served-by-Town-and-Medical-Benefit-Plan/f6un-nnhn/about_data">CT Open Data – DSS People Served by Town and Medical Benefit Plan</a> to understand the structure of the <a href="https://www.cthealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Medicaid-in-CT-fact-sheet.pdf">HUSKY</a> program and the availability of town-level Medicaid enrollment data. Using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z591EpnYz0o8RzMKS7jWb-4o-QECtmtFOrVhX56Kmc8/edit?gid=1248235720#gid=1248235720">Isabel’s updated sheet</a>, we identified which schools offered SBHC services and which did not, and we used this same dataset to determine which districts had no services at all. Our next steps involved defining clear income categories (low, middle, and high) and finding reliable datasets for SBHC locations, median household income, and Medicaid coverage by town or district. After gathering the data, we cleaned and merge the <a href="<a href="https://www.cthealth.org/topic-guides/medicaid-in-ct/">Medicaid topic Guide</a>bar charts</a> by standardizing town names and adding indicators for SBHC presence, income, and Medicaid levels. With a unified dataset, we created visualizations such as  comparing income levels in towns with and without SBHCs, and maps showing Medicaid rates alongside SBHC locations <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b78Rb/1/">with SBHC</a> and <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cXbbN/1/">without SBHC</a>. Finally, we analyzed our results and summarize the full process for future students, including explanations of how we obtained our data, important steps in cleaning and interpretation, and acknowledgments of the people, tools, and resources that supported our work. </p> 
          
        <p>  When working with any data, there are cautions when interpreting the data. There are several limitations in the data. First, some datasets come from different years, which means income levels, Medicaid enrollment, and SBHC availability may not align perfectly in time. Also, town and district boundaries do not always match, so data reported by town may not reflect the exact populations served by specific schools or SBHCs. The presence of an SBHC does not necessarily indicate the level or quality of services provided, and our dataset does not capture differences in capacity, staffing, or funding across centers. Medicaid enrollment varies widely by age, eligibility category, and verification timing, so percent-Medicaid figures should be interpreted as estimates rather than exact counts. T differences in how organizations report data, such as naming conventions or categories, may create inconsistencies even after cleaning. Finally, correlation does not imply causation: towns with SBHCs may differ in income or Medicaid rates for reasons unrelated to SBHC presence, so our comparisons should be understood as descriptive rather than causal.</p> 
          
       <p>  We want to acknowledge the people and organizations who supported us throughout this project. Our professor, Jack, guided us in shaping our research question and helped us understand how to approach data storytelling thoughtfully. We are also grateful to our research assistant, Ali Macdougall, for helping us navigate our data sources and refine our methods, and to our TA, Nellie, who supported us in creating clear charts and understanding the goals of the final data story. We also benefited from valuable feedback from our community partners, whose insights helped us interpret our findings and stay grounded in real community needs. Finally, we relied on essential information from the U.S. Census Bureau, CT Health Foundation, Connecticut Department of Education, and the Connecticut Directory of School-Based Health Centers, whose publicly available data made this project possible.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>  Overall, our data visualizations reveal a strong relationship between community need and the presence of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) in Connecticut. Towns with lower median household incomes and higher percentages of residents enrolled in Medicaid (HUSKY) are much more likely to have SBHCs. This suggests that many centers are being placed where they can have the greatest impact, serving students who face more barriers to accessing traditional healthcare. At the same time, the maps highlight gaps. Neighboring towns with very different income levels or Medicaid enrollment rates sometimes show major differences in SBHC availability, raising many important questions about equity and access.<p>  

<p>  Understanding where SBHCs are located and who may be missing out helps us see how economic and structural factors shape children's ability to receive essential health services. While our analysis cannot determine causation, it provides a meaningful descriptive picture of statewide disparities. Future research could explore how SBHC capacity, funding, or school-level characteristics influence access, and how expanding SBHC coverage could reduce these gaps.<p>  

<p>  By combining data on income, Medicaid enrollment, and SBHC distribution, this project shows the importance of placing health resources where students need them most. Better data, continued community partnerships, and thoughtful policy decisions can help ensure that all children regardless of where they live have access to the school-based health services that support their well-being and future success.

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>
