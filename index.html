          <h2>Introduction: Where Are School-Based Health Centers — and Who’s Missing Out?</h2>

          <p>  For a lot of children, schools aren't just places for learning. They are community spaces where children spend majority of their time and life where they go to access support for their physical, mental, and environmental health and well being. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) play a big role in this support system. They provide students with the access they need for medical, mental health, and sometimes dental services directly in their schools. For some students who face barries to healthcare like lack of insurance, transportation, community support, and flexible work schedules SBHC’s can be life changing for families.  
              Unfortunately, In Connecticut, not every school district or town has a SBHC. This uneven access may reflect broader inequities across communities which raises important questions about equity. Are SBHC’s located in towns that need them most - the towns with higher poverty rates, and larger populations relying on health insurance? Are the only in towns or wealthier areas with fewer barriers to receiving care? 
Our question asks: how towns with School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) differ from those without -in terms of median household income and the percentage of residents receiving Medicaid health insurance (also known as “HUSKY” or a “medical benefit plan” from CT Dept of Social Services, DSS). These two indicators show much more about broader economic and healthcare access disparities across Connecticut. If towns lacking SBHCs generally have higher incomes and fewer residents on Medicaid, that could mean that the communities with the greatest need for school-based health services may have the least access to them. 	</p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>

    

        <p> This bar chart shows the comparison of Median Household Income in towns that have SBHC's and towns that do not. </p>

        <iframe title="Median Value of Median Household Income in Connecticut Towns" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-THCIx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/THCIx/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="656" height="485" data-external="1"></iframe>

       <p> This is important as it shows that towns that have a lower median household income tend to have more SBHC's. This is a good thing as there may be a higher need in the communities that are recieving acess to the SBHC's. </p>

       <p> Both of these interactive chloropleth maps show the Median Household Income of Towns with SBHC’s vs. Towns without SBHC’s. It also shows how many SBHC’s are in each town.  </p>

           <p> This is important as it shows how some towns that boarder each other (New Britain vs. Newington) can have a vast difference in the amount of SBHC’S. There is a 13:1 difference, respectively. Children’s health needs can be more difficult to meet due to the location of their school and home. </p>

          <h2>Our Process</h2>

          <p>For our project, we began by defining our main research question: how Connecticut towns with school-based health centers differ from those without them in terms of median household income and the percentage of residents receiving Medicaid, including HUSKY A, B, C, D, and MSP. We reviewed background information from the Medicaid topic guide and CT Open Data – DSS People Served by Town and Medical Benefit Plan to understand the structure of the HUSKY program and the availability of town-level Medicaid enrollment data. Using Isabel’s updated sheet, we identified which schools offered SBHC services and which did not, and we used this same dataset to determine which districts had no services at all. Our next steps involved defining clear income categories (low, middle, and high) and finding reliable datasets for SBHC locations, median household income, and Medicaid coverage by town or district. After gathering the data, we cleaned and merge the datasets by standardizing town names and adding indicators for SBHC presence, income, and Medicaid levels. With a unified dataset, we created visualizations such as bar charts comparing income levels in towns with and without SBHCs, and maps showing Medicaid rates alongside SBHC locations with SBHC and without SBHC. Finally, we analyzed our results and summarize the full process for future students, including explanations of how we obtained our data, important steps in cleaning and interpretation, and acknowledgments of the people, tools, and resources that supported our work. 
            When working with any data, there are cautions when interpreting the data. There are several limitations in the data. First, some datasets come from different years, which means income levels, Medicaid enrollment, and SBHC availability may not align perfectly in time. Also, town and district boundaries do not always match, so data reported by town may not reflect the exact populations served by specific schools or SBHCs. The presence of an SBHC does not necessarily indicate the level or quality of services provided, and our dataset does not capture differences in capacity, staffing, or funding across centers. Medicaid enrollment varies widely by age, eligibility category, and verification timing, so percent-Medicaid figures should be interpreted as estimates rather than exact counts. T differences in how organizations report data, such as naming conventions or categories, may create inconsistencies even after cleaning. Finally, correlation does not imply causation: towns with SBHCs may differ in income or Medicaid rates for reasons unrelated to SBHC presence, so our comparisons should be understood as descriptive rather than causal.
            We want to acknowledge the people and organizations who supported us throughout this project. Our professor, Jack, guided us in shaping our research question and helped us understand how to approach data storytelling thoughtfully. We are also grateful to our research assistant, Ali Macdougall, for helping us navigate our data sources and refine our methods, and to our TA, Nellie, who supported us in creating clear charts and understanding the goals of the final data story. We also benefited from valuable feedback from our community partners, whose insights helped us interpret our findings and stay grounded in real community needs. Finally, we relied on essential information from the U.S. Census Bureau, CT Health Foundation, Connecticut Department of Education, and the Connecticut Directory of School-Based Health Centers, whose publicly available data made this project possible.

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
